# Dygma Raise configuration

Making some notes about the configuration, for my future self to understand what the hell was the idea. The official nomenclature for the 8-split spacebar is T1~T8, left to right & top to bottom.  
&nbsp;  
In all layers, white keys are for layer swap. I use "one shot layer" keys for Function keys and OS functions, these work as shift to layer when held, and if I need to lock the layer I can double tap (eg to use cursor keys). For other layers I have dual function keys (details below).  
LED off means the key is unassigned, so I know what I have available at a glance.  
Currently I'm on revision 5 of the setup, changes happened naturally on my first month of use and as I grew more used to dual function keys. The most important lesson was to keep the key that I use to activate a layer opposite to the features I use the most without locking on it, in particular for things that aren't a quick tap.  
The latest revision adds two extra layers to deal with Windows specifically (work computer).  

## General settings

These are values for the "Preferences" section, that controls timeouts for dual functions and mouse keys speed.

### Typing

  * Dual function overlap threshold: 40
  * Dual function hold timeout: 105
  * Superkey next tap timeout: 200
  * Superkey hold timeout: 175

### Mouse

  * Cursor speed: 20
  * Cursor acceleration: 35
  * Max cursor speed: 80
  * Wheel speed: 4

## Layer 1 - "Base"

From my MD770 days I got used to having modifiers in my thumbs (Space/Control on the left spacebar, and ESC/Control on the right spacebar), which is very convenient for Emacs. I'm keeping that in the Raise, in T2 and T3.  
T1 is F6, which is bound to my personal keymap in Emacs. T4 is backspace.
The thumbs keys in the bottom row are all layer changes, with some extra features:
  * T5 goes to layer 3, OS/window management, arrow keys, media.
  * T6 has dual function: Enter on tap, activate layer 4 on hold (symbols for programming and compose key in Gnome to type in Spanish)
  * T7 activates layer 5. It is almost identical to the base but most keys have the shift modifier. This frees up both shift keys on the sides and makes chording for shift use the thumb instead of pinky finger.
  * T8 goes to layer 2, Function keys, browser/app shorcuts, and mouse keys
&nbsp;  
I still need proper Alt modifiers for other applications, but since I can trigger Control and Shift with thumbs and layers, I can repurpose those keys and a few others:   

* Left control: Jump to Excel layer
* Right control: Change language macro
* Caps Lock: F7, which is assigned to `ctl-x-map` in Emacs.
* Left shift: Prefix argument (C-u) for Emacs commands.
* Right shift: Negative argument (C--). Now using `cycle-spacing` to collapse empty lines is a breeze. 
* Enter: F5, a secondary personal prefix key for Emacs commands (mostly related to registers).
* Backspace: Lock to layer 7, which can be seen as "switch to Windows mode"

## Layer 2 - "F-keys/Browser/Mouse"

Since I activate this layer on the right side, it has arrows on left side, but with the Alt modifier applied. They can be used to move between chats in Signal and Discord, for example. In addition, around the arrows there's a couple Firefox-oriented bindings: Ctrl+Shift+Tab and Ctrl+Tab to move between tabs, Ctrl+Shift+T to reopen the last tab, etc. Also, the keys Z, X, C and V are mapped with a Control modifier for undo/copy/etc. This technically belongs, and it is mapped, in layer 3 too.  
The right side has mouse keys, which I would use locking the layer (so having both activation and keys on the same side is not as uncomfortable). Mouse buttons to click are on the sides of "up" plus thumb keys, middle click below the arrows, the scrool wheel on the side. After adjusting the settings for mouse speed and acceleration, this setup has been convenient here and there.  
Finally, the number row is for F-keys, so this layer has the same modifiers as Layer 1 plus Shift keys on their usually positions, to allow for Ctrl+F1, Shift+F1, etc.

## Layer 3 - "OS Linux/Arrows/Media"

In this layer, the number row has the Win/Super modifier applied. The only reason I still need a Windows key in the base layer is for things like Win+V for clipboard history.
I rely _a lot_ on the Win+# shortcuts to move between applications. I also use Win+arrows in Gnome Windows to tile and maximize applications, and to move applications between monitors. These are on the left side as ESDF arrows, plus an extra left/right that adds shift. Again, not umcomfortable since I mostly tap these.  
Gnome workspaces shortcuts are mapped on top of the arrow/move windows keys.  
On the right side there are arrow keys mapped to IJKL, surrounded by Home/End/PageUp/PageDown. A lot of times, moving with arrows implies expanding text selections (when not in Emacs, at least) so the layer also has shift and control keys in their usual positions. I am also experimenting with arrows to move left & right with the shift modifier applied, in `m` and `.`, to expand text selections.  
Finally since I used the media keys on my MD770 a lot, I am mapping playback and volume in (and around) the T1~4 keys in the top row.  
I moved Alt+F4 from T7, where I tapped it accidentally, to right shift. Win/Super is still in T6. I still haven't found a new use for T7.

## Layer 4 - "Symbols"

Here I mapped symbols that are useful for programming and moved them to keys close to the home row. Braces, parenthesis (obviously), math symbols, all types of quotes, etc.   
There are rev4 additions to this layer: `'` and `~` are mapped with the compose modifier (the solo `'` has custom location with all other quote types), some more programming symbols, and DEL in the location that has Backspace in layer 1 (T4 key).

## Layer 5 - "Base + Shift"

This is mostly the same as layer 1, but keys have the shift modifier applied. Including Enter and TAB. Backspace is mapped to the super key for accented characters, in case I have to type an uppercase √Å :)

## Layer 6 - "Excel (and numpad)"

It finally happened. This layer came to life after I had to work for a couple hours on spreadsheets. It is intended to be used locked, having on the left side arrows in the ESDF position, with easy undo/redo in Z and Q. It also has a convenient Alt+= for the "SUM in range" shortcut in the 6 key.  
The right side has a numpad, with backspace bumped one row down (to make room for 0), next to delete and Esc. Basically everything I need to quickly move around cells and edit them.

## Layer 7 - "Base for Windows"

When I am using my work laptop, I switch to this layer as a replacemente base. So far, the only difference is that the OS layer is #8 instead of #3. But in teh future can accomodate more Windows-specific changes, or jump other customized layers.  
The Backspace key toggles to the Linux layer via a "Lock to 1".

## Layer 8 - "OS Windows/Arrows/Media"

This started as a clone of Layer 3 but with keys to move workspaces adjusted to Windows' multiple desktops usage. Turns out though, that the feature in Windows is quite incomplete, and basically unusuable with keyboard only. I created a macro that does the dance to move the current window to a new desktop, but there's no key to close a virtual desktop, or to move an application to the next/prev desktop. Bleh.  
At least I get to customize the screenshot key (from PrintScreen in Gnome, to Win+Shift+S in Windows) and add Ctrl+Alt+Del in the Backspace position.
